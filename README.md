# Heart Attack Prediction and Analysis Using Kaggle Dataset and Machine Learning

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of heart attack data using Python, delivered through the Jupyter Notebook environment. It employs a range of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on the available data. To improve model performance, we fine-tune hyperparameters using grid and random search. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC. 

The findings from this analysis aim to provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers, potentially aiding in the development of targeted prevention strategies and interventions. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis techniques, this project highlights the power of data-driven approaches in addressing complex health challenges.
